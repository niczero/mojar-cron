=head1 NAME

Mojar::Cron - Cron-style datetime patterns and algorithm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mojar::Cron;
  my $c = Mojar::Cron->new(is_local => 1, pattern => '0 9 * * mon');
  my $t = time;
  $t = $c->next($t);  # next instance of 9am Monday
  say "Need to wait another $t seconds."

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A time pattern is a sequence of six components: second, minute, hour, day,
month, weekday (the component for 'second' may be omitted for brevity and
consistency with standard cron syntax) and supports C<@>-expressions in the
weekday component.  Each of the first four components consists of a
comma-separated list of patterns.

  2
  1,3,5
  1-4,6
  */2

The 'month' component can use those patterns, but may also use English prefices
in place of numbers.

  apr-jun,oct-dec  # instead of 4-6,10-12

The 'weekday' component can do similarly.

  mon-fri  # instead of 1-5
  mon,wed,fri  # instead of 1,3,5

(Note that this implementation also supports 'wrap around' patterns such as
C<fri-mon> and C<oct-mar>.)

In keeping with standard cron, a time pattern may specify sequences for both day
and weekday in the same pattern.  This can cause confusion because the pattern
is satisfied if either sequence is satisfied.

  00 00 00 01  * mon  # midnight on the first of each month and also each Monday

The weekday component may use C<@>-expressions, but in this case the 'day' and
'month' components must be unspecified.

  00 00 00  *  * @mon#1      # first Monday of each month
  00 00 16  *  * @5#L        # last Friday of each month
  00 00 16  *  * @week#L     # last week day (Mon-Fri) of each month
  00 00 03  *  * @weekend#1  # first weekend day (Sat-Sun) of each month

There are also special expressions which can replace the whole time pattern.

  00 01 00  *  * *  # @nightly
  00 01 06  *  * *  # @morningly
  00 01 12  *  * *  # @daily
  00 01 18  *  * *  # @eveningly

Cron patterns of the kind C<*/n> have a weakness that they only specify jumps
within their sequence.  For example the 'day' pattern C<*/15> will trigger on
1st, 16th, 31st January and then again on 1st February; the pattern resets at
the end of its sequence (month days).  This might not be what you expect or
want, so we also have yearday patterns.  These have the same behaviour, but
because they don't reset till the end of the year, they get closer to what
people expect.

  00 00 00  *  * :*/2  # every two days through the year

=head2 C<satisfiable>

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

For consistency with cron, patterns are one-based for day and month, but
internally (using Mojar::Cron::Datetime) everything is zero-based.  So
when debugging your code C<[0,0,0,0,0,0]> would be '1900-01-01 00:00:00' and
C<[[0],[0],[0],undef,undef,[1]]> would be '00 00 00 * * 1'.

The main algorithm is thanks to Paul Evans (leonerd@leonerd.org.uk).  I hope I
have implemented it in a readable way, and it turns out doing so revealed a few
bugs in the original.
